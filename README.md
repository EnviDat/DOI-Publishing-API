# doi-publishing-api

Microservice API to publish DOIs on Datacite.

[View the API docs](https://www.envidat.ch/doi-api/docs)

## Email 

This service works in tandem with the email relay server [Catapulte](https://github.com/jdrouet/catapulte).

The EnviDat email microservice can be found [here](https://gitlabext.wsl.ch/EnviDat/email-microservice).

## Development Usage

## Environment Variables

1. Make a file named `.env` in the root directory

2. Generate the variables using `env.example` as a reference

3. New environment variables must be added to:
      - `env.example` because this file is used for validation
      - `environment` section of the `doi-api` containers in the `docker-compose.<branch>.yml` files

### Option 1: Docker

1. Run the docker container:

```bash
docker compose up  -f <docker compose file> -d
```

> The image should pull, or fallback to building.


### Option 2: Standalone

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv <virtual-environment-name>
   or
Create a virtual environment with PyCharm

<virtual-environment-name>\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the FastAPI server directly with PDM:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

3. Access at: http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Production Usage

1. Configure environment variables used in production

   - Create **individual CI/CD variables for each variable** listed in `env.example`
   - `APP_VERSION` **must be incremented** so that a new image is built and the application includes the updated code
     - Create a git tag for the commit that corresponds to the `APP_VERSION`
   - `ROOT_PATH` is an optional environment variable and should only be used to if the application uses a proxy
     - Be sure to include a `/` before the `ROOT_PATH` value
     - Example configuration: `ROOT_PATH=/doi-api`
     - [Click here for the FastAPI documentation about using a proxy server](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/behind-a-proxy/)
   - Create **individual CI/CD variables for each the following variables** (apart from the ones in env.example) that are used for deployment:

     > | Key                        | Example Value                    |
     > |----------------------------| -------------------------------- |
     > | `APP_VERSION`              | `1.1.2`                          |
     > | `ROOT_PATH`                | `""`                             
     > | `INTERNAL_REG`             | `registry-gitlab.org.ch/orgname` |
     > | `EXTERNAL_REG`             | `docker.io`                      |
     > | `NGINX_IMG_TAG`            | `1.25`                           |
     > | `PYTHON_IMG_TAG`           | `3.10`                           |
     > | `DEPLOY_HOSTNAME`          | `server.wsl.ch`                  |
     > | `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`           | `encryption private key`         |
     > | `DEPLOY_SSH_USER`          | `test_user`                      |
    
2. Merge feature/development branch to `main` default branch
   - The `main` branch has a pipeline set up in `.gitlab-ci.yml` that automatically deploys changes to production server
   - The pipeline also requires CI/CD variables that are used to that are used to build and register a Docker image of the application: `IMAGE_REGISTRY_USER` and `IMAGE_REGISTRY_PASS`
     - The image related variables can be group variables inherited from the parent group

## Pre-commit hooks

- To run the pre-commit hooks manually open app in terminal and execute: `pre-commit run --all-files`
- These hooks ensure that the application uses standard stylistic conventions
- To view or alter the pre-commit hooks see: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

## Tests

- Tests are located in `tests`
- To run tests manually open app in terminal and execute: `pytest`

## Scripts

- Scripts are located in the `scripts` directory
